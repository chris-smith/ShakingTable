ShakingTable
============

This directory contains code for running the shaky table in coordination with two Arduino heart rate monitors. The Arduino running the table should be loaded with the two_motor_control_py sketch from the Arduino directory. The Python directory contains code to be run from a Macbook to communicate between the Shaky Table and heart rate monitors. More information can be found in the doc folder.
